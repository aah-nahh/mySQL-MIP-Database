# mySQL-MIP-Database

# this is a practice database with mostly fake dummy data included to demonstrate its functionality rather than its content accuracy

In theory, this database creates a searchable archive of information documenting historical military interventions that the U.S. has taken part in either as a lead or partner country. It seeks to compile, consolidate, draw connections, and make accessible a large body of information about an issue that has had profound effects on global governments and economies. Potential users are students, researchers, policymakers, diplomats, activists involved in peacemaking, and anyone interested in U.S. and global history.
- Which administration(s) was responsible for the most amount of military interventions, or time involved in a conflict? 
- Which administration(s) was responsible for the largest scope of military expenditures, and/or human costs, and/or other key effects?
- Which region has the U.S. focused the majority of its interventions on, and has this changed over time? 
- Who and where has suffered the most in terms of human cost? 
- Is there a correlation between a country’s relative GDP or budget and an increase in military intervention? 
- What military objective has been cited the most?
- Which objective is correlated with the greatest financial impacts and/or human costs?
